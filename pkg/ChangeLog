	* R/asub.R: add function asub() to subscript arrays on specified
	dimensions
	* R/afill.R: add function afill() <- value to fill subarrays on specified
	dimensions

	* R/abind.R man/abind.Rd
	Allow first argument of abind() to be a list of objects to be
	bound -- this avoids the need for do.call() when one wants to bind
	a list of objects

	* R/abind.R man/abind.Rd
	Changed argument name 'use.anon.names' to the more intuitive
	'make.names' (the argument 'use.anon.names' still works)

	* R/abind.R man/abind.Rd
	Changed default value for 'make.names' to FALSE (now more closely
	behaves like rbind() and cbind()).  This means that dimension
        names for dimensions that have no names are only constructed
        when requested, not by default.

	* R/adrop.R man/adrop.Rd
	Added new function adrop().  This is a function like drop(), but
	it allows to user to specify which of the dimensions with extent
	one will be dropped.
